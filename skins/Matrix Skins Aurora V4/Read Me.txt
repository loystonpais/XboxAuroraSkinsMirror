These are Version 2 of the Original Aurora Matrix Skins, 
Reduced File Size without losing Quality of Images/Music. 

Saved up to 40mb per skin going from Version 1 to Version 4. >=)

Optional Tweaks you can do so the skins run a little Smoother:

Disable Aurora Animation in the "View" Menu. (Looks better with it on tho.)

Disable Auto Scan on both Title Updates & Manage Paths. (you dont need to AutoScan on every boot, only when you add a game or coverart.)

(Doing this will free up some background process on Cold Boot.
since the 360, Aurora, and the background Music will be fighting for the ram.)

Custom Skin Known Bug:

Lots of custom skins tend to crash/freeze Aurora on Cold boot. 
this can happen if you push B on your controller, to go to the "View" menu as soon as Aurora Boots. 
Even the Aurora Default skin can do this! Dont Panic. 

To avoid this bug: 

Just Restart the Xbox360, Wait about 30sec for Aurora to Boot into the main menu (the screen that shows your games), 
you'll know when its done loading when your Hidden games Disappear Or if your using a Cover layout other than the default (Example: Bookshelf) loads in.
Aurora just need a few secs on cold boots to load, cause on a cold boot from a completely shutdown console Aurora boots into default settings THEN loads your settings. 
Takes about 30secs.

So to Recap: 
Turn on Xbox360 
Dont push the B button on your Controller on Cold Boot for 30secs 
Wait for Aurora to load. Easy right?
